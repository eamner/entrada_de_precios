Little PHP page and script for data entry using json_encode and a little Bootstrap for UI
This is part of a larger project but here the client only needed a small page to enter the 
Price tags for Air/Sea customs.
Note: the folder Lectura is not used at all. It was left here for informational purposes about the previous version of the code.
